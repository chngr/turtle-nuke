Misc notes (Paul)
=================

We can somewhat filter groups to send messages to with sticky and guard, e.g.
could add age range guards, behavior guards (would need to override
checkGuard in SoldierRobot). Subscription might be better, having
a list of pseudo-ids that can be subscribed to, but thought I'd 
better not mess with internal communicator logic. Guards,
particularly with behavior, aren't too bad - we can wait until we
need better.
